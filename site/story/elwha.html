	<p>The course of the Elwha River starts in the Olympic Mountains and runs 45 miles down to the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The people of the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe, whose reservation sits at the river’s mouth, have lived on its banks for thousands of years.</p>
	
	<p>“Our tribal stories say we were created on the Elwha River,” said Robert Elofson, the river restoration director for the tribe. “But the oldest artifacts are 2,700 years old.”</p>
	
	<p>In the beginning of the 20th century, an entrepreneur named Thomas Aldwell saw the river as an untapped source of power and profit. He arranged for the construction of two hydroelectric dams, the first in 1913 and the second in 1923.</p>
	
	<p>A Washington State law required Aldwell to outfit the lower dam, called the Elwha Dam, with salmon ladders, which would allow the river’s huge, diverse fish population to access their spawning grounds upriver. But the he ignored the law, and in 1927 went on to build a second dam, Glines Canyon Dam, out of solid rock. No method of fish passage was provided for that one either. </p>
	
	<p>The salmon’s spawning ground was truncated from nearly 70 miles of river and streams to the five miles between the ocean and the Elwha Dam. Besides the damage caused to the river’s ecosystem, dam construction came as a huge blow to the Elwha Tribe. </p>
	
	<p>The Elwha people relied on the fish coming up the river and the forest that responded to the nutrients and life from the ocean. Furthermore, the Lower Elwha Klallam’s creation site was located on the banks of the river, and when the Elwha Dam was installed, this sacred site was covered by over 100 feet of water for more than a century.</p>
	
	<p>But the dams provided power to the burgeoning communities of the Olympic Peninsula and supported local economies. Over time, the Olympic Peninsula grew too big to rely on the dams and began to draw their power from other sources. </p>
	
	<p>“By the time we made a motion to remove of the dams in 1986, [the dams] provided just half the electricity for one paper mill in Port Angeles,” Elofson said. </p>
	
	<p>So in 1992, the US Congress voted to remove the dams, restore the river ecosystem and native fish populations. Dam removal began in 2011, and by THIS MONTH, the Elwha Dam was gone. Blast by blast, the Glines Canyon Dam will be gone by summer of 2013.</p>
	
	<p>At approximately $324.7 million, the dam removal and restoration process is the largest and most expensive in United States history. </p>
	
	<p>But ___ has high hopes for ___</p>
	
	<p>“This is where I will manage to scrounge up a quote from the hatcheries man about the fish repopulation,” said the hatcheries man.</p>
	
	<p>OR I can use this Robert quote:</p>
	
	<p>“We've only had between 3 to 5000 salmon coming back and the only ones we've been able to harvest commercially are the ones we've been releasing from our hatchery,” said Elofson.</p>
	
	<p>AND I end with this Robert quote:</p>
	
	<p>“The last word that my generation has on the river is what our grandparents told us it was like when it was free. We know that our grandkids will see it the same way they did.”</p>
