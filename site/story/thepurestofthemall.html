<h1>The Purest of Them All</h1>

<p>When most Americans talk about good tasting water, they may not know it, but they’re talking about water that tastes like their own spit, said Gary Burlingame who supervises water quality for the Philadelphia Water Department.</p>

<p>“When you taste something, you're comparing the taste of that water to the saliva in your mouth,” Burlingame said. “The saliva in your mouth is salty.”</p>

<p>Salty saliva bathes your tongue, drenching every single one of your thousands of taste buds. It protects you from nasty bacteria, moistens your food, helps you pronounce the word “stalactite” and lets you know when you’re drinking something bad for you.</p>

<p>Like water. Pure water that is.</p>

<p>Stripping water down to an ultrapure state makes it unfit for human consumption. It’s bland, flat and gross.</p>

<p>Water molecules have a slight negative charge, which means they’re good at dissolving. This is why they clean so well – they pull other molecules apart.</p>

<p>In the world of electronics, manufacturers remove all of the minerals, dissolved gas and dirt particles from water to work its cleaning ability to the max: the result is something called ultrapure water. They use it to clean tiny, sensitive equipment.</p>

<p>But if you were to drink ultra-pure water, it would literally drink you back. The moment it were to come through your lips, it would start leeching valuable minerals from your saliva.</p>

<p>“Your mouth wants potassium and magnesium and other minerals,” said Arthur von Wiesenberger, a professional water taster. “It can tell when it’s being stripped.”</p>

<p>Fortunately pure water is rarely found in nature. Water is constantly moving (link to water cycle?) and passing through rock and soil, picking up minerals and chemicals as it goes. You need these minerals; they strengthen bones, build up muscle, lower blood pressure and digest food.</p>

<p>“Good tasting water has a recipe of minerals at a little bit below room temperature so its refreshing,” Burlingame said. </p>

<p>The sense of taste is more limited than you may realize. Your tongue can sense sweet, bitter, salty, sour and umami or meaty.  That’s it. You think that’s chlorine you taste in your tap water? Nope. It’s chlorine you smell. </p>

<p>“When you drink and taste, you’re smelling it at the same time,” Burlingame said.</p>

<p>When water passes through your mouth, it activates the taste buds on your tongue, but some of it turns into a gas and floats up the back of your throat to your nose.</p> 

<p>The biggest complaints Americans have about their tap water are due to smell. It’s a chlorine smell, a sulfurous odor from iron, a metallic smell from rusting pipes or an earthy odor from algae (which actually the same as the smell of rain (link to smell of rain.))</p>

<p>“In America, we drink water for what’s not in it,” von Wiesenberger said.  (I need a different transition sentence here)</p>

<p>You don’t’ want chlorine, rust, earthy-odor. You want water to taste like nothing, Water that’s pure…Well not pure, pure, but we know what you mean.</p>
