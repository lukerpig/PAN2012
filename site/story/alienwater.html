<h1>“Follow the Water”</h1>

<p>On Valentine’s Day of 1990, the Voyager 1, an unmanned space probe, hurtled through the orbits of Neptune and Pluto at 40,000 mph. [The mission control crew prepared to turn off the cameras off to save the batteries ]</p>

<p>Astronomer and writer Carl Sagan was among the participating scientists, and he convinced the [crew] to swing the camera around for one last glimpse homeward. That backward look was the first time the solar system had been seen from the outside. The camera snapped about 60 pictures, and in one of them, a humble point of blue light can be barely seen in the corner of a sunbeam: Earth.</p>

<p>“Look again at that dot,” Sagan later wrote. “That’s here. That’s home. That’s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives.”</p>

<p>Among the many things that make this dot unique and precious is that which makes it blue: Oceans, rivers, great lakes, inland seas – liquid water. </p>

<p>Liquid water is an ideal medium for life, and our sloshing planet teems with it. We evolved in these waters, and they have become the paradigm for our search for life elsewhere in the universe.</p>

<h2>The Hunt for Water</h2>

<p>Space is full of water. In fact, it’s probably the most common molecule in the universe. </p>

<p>But there’s a catch. Most of it is going to be either water vapor or ice. Liquid water is hard to find, and life needs it.  (want to know why? Link to sidebar)</p>
 

<p>“It’s NASA idea of exploration: we should follow the water in the universe,” said Andrew Pohorille, the director of astrobiology at NASA Ames Research Center. “If there is liquid water, then chances are fairly good there might be life.”</p>

<p>The pursuit of liquid water as a strategy to find life can be traced to that photograph snapped by Voyager 1, said Pohorille.</p>

<p>“If somebody observed the Earth from a great distance, they would see this pale blue dot,” said Pohorille.  “So we think ‘let’s look for other pale blue dots that might look like the Earth.’”</p>

<p>Our planet is happily situated in what astronomers call the ‘goldilocks zone’ or the habitable zone, where the water won’t freeze or boil away.
In our solar system, Pluto’s too far away from the sun for liquid water, Mercury’s too close, but Earth is just right. We’re at the perfect location for the temperature and pressure to support oceans, lakes, rivers and seas.</p>

<p>When they look for life beyond the solar system, astronomers search for other star systems with planets in the goldilocks zone.</p>

<p>In 2011, NASA’s Kepler Mission confirmed the first planet outside our solar system in the goldilocks zone orbiting a star that’s not too different from our sun. It would take us 600 years, traveling at the speed of light, to reach this planet.</p>

<p>They haven’t figured out if there’s liquid water on the surface, but its not ruled out.*</p>
 
<p>Since finding Kepler 22b, the mission has identified hundreds of candidates that may be ‘just right’ for life. </p>

<p>“In one or two years, you're going to be hearing about all sorts of goldilocks planets that might be like the Earth,” said Seth Shostak, senior astronomer at the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute.</p>

<p>“Finding planets that might be like the Earth,” said Shostak. “Everybody can understand why that might be interesting.”</p>

<p>Our own organic bodies sloshi</p>

<p> “We were created in water, in oceans, and for the first three quarters of life on earth, everything was in the water,” Shostak said. “Without water, we don’t live very long.”</p>

<p>In the meantime, we’ve scoured the rocks of Mars, peeked under the heavy atmospheres of Saturn’s moons, and so far, nothing has looked back.</p>

<p>So we strain our eyes further, looking for water and hoping we’ll find more.</p>

<p>After all, as Sagan wrote, we can’t help it. “Life looks for life.”</p>

<p>We continue to learn about the character of our varied and interesting solar system in a universe that’s largely unknown</p>

<p>“We can explain the wan blueness of this little world because we know it well…a thick but transparent atmosphere and its deep oceans of liquid water.”</p>
