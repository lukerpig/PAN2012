<h1>Collecting Rainwater</h1>

<p>All water fell from the sky at some point. The ground caught it and sent it deeper into the soil or washed it down into streams, rivers, roots, roads and dams. Somewhere within this process, water is diverted from reservoirs to treatment plants to pipes to taps and down into our throats. </p>

<p>This is where the policy comes in. In 1974 the Safe Drinking Water Act was passed, requiring the EPA to establish national standards for contaminants in drinking water systems, and there was a disconnect between rain and drinking water.</p>

<p>“Rain is the source for all water, goddamnit!” said Richard Heinichen. While no one disagrees...</p>


<p>The law in America: Most states don’t have any statutes or regulations when it comes to rainwater harvesting, and for the one’s who have something to say, the law varies from state to state. In the dryer southwestern states, rain ownership is naturally a subject of more scrutiny. In Utah, for instance up until xxxx, the state itself claimed every single drop that fell from the sky.</p>

<p>In Colorado, the rain is owned by the state as a public resource. Since 2009, only landowners who have no access to public water are allowed to collect rain, and even then only in small amounts.</p>
