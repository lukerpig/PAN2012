TODO:
-Make layout/draft site
-Mosaic page (Have watch again button)
-Hashtags
-Ramdomize starting video (only on Replay?)
-Color last marker
-Don't start video again after it's finished
-Level2 Stories 62.5%
-If you play an unrelated story, it calls out related "pause" data, not related story stuff
-Stop screwing up when scrollbar disappears

NICE TO HAVE:
-exact lineup of markers and vid
-display:none unactive stories
-Sound plays on puase to mask pause
-lightbox
-animated scroll out stories
-Knowing where in the video user is so pause sends out right content
-scrolling for text stories
-possible custom scrollbar
-scroll wheel support
-splashpage
-endingpage
-designing what a story looks like/story format
-conecpt video changes either on refresh or after clicking a button





Open Issues:
-How to get lightbox to go over main page and not just in iframe
-How do you play sounds on scrollin/scrollout
-Scrollwheel functionality
-customize scrollbar
